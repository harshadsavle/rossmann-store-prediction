<h2> :book: Random Forest</h2>

<p>Random forest is a supervised learning algorithm. It creates a "forest" out of an ensemble of decision trees, which are commonly trained using the "bagging" method. The bagging method's basic premise is that combining different learning models improves the overall output.
Simply said, random forest combines many decision trees to produce a more accurate and stable prediction.


<p>Furthermore, the random forest classifier is efficient, can handle a large number of input variables, and provides correct predictions in most cases. It's a very strong tool that doesn't require any coding to implement.</p>

<h2> :chart_with_upwards_trend: Exploratory Data Analysis</h2>
<p>There were more sales on Monday, probably because shops generally remain closed on Sundays which had the lowest sales in a week. 
Store type B though being few in number had the highest sales average. The reasons include all three kinds of assortments specially assortment level b which is only available at type b stores and being open on sundays as well.
The outliers in the dataset showed justifiable behaviour. The outliers were either of store type b or had promotion going on which increased sales.</p>
<p>Store type B was open on all seven days of the week and had more sales than any other store type and promotion had a positive effect across all store types.<p>

<h2> :chart_with_upwards_trend: Results</h2>
<p>Random Forest Tuned Model gave the best results and the patterns that could be captured by the model without overfitting was captured achieving a R^2 of 0.95 which helps in allocation of resources and proper planning for the company's growth.
